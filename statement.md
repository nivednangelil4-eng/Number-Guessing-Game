# Problem Statement
The objective of this python code is to build a simple,console-based Number Guessing Name.in this project, we mainly uses the simple conditional statements, loops and simple modules.The computer randomly selects the number between 0-100 including them and give the user 5 tries to guess the number.

# Scope of the Project
The scope of this project is strictly limited to a command-line interface (CLI) application. 
It focuses on the core game logic: generating a random integer, handling five rounds of user guesses, providing "high/low" hints, and managing the game-over conditions.

# Target User
The primary target users are:
* Beginner Programmers: Students learning basic programming concepts who need a small, defined project to practice Python syntax and control flow.
* Casual Users: Anyone looking for a quick, simple, and nostalgic command-line game to pass the time.

# High-Level Features
* Game Initialisation: Generate a random number selected by the computer between 0-100, including both.
* Guessing Loop: Loop runs upto 5 attempts and ends.
* Comment: After checking the guessed number with the selected number by the computer, proper comment will be given whether the number is high or low.
* Win Condition: If the guess is correct, the program terminates with a congratulation message.
* Loss Condition: If all the 5 guesses are incorrect, the program terminates with a lost message.
* Replay: Asks the user whether it needs to start the new game or not.
